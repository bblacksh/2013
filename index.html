<p>
Artists that meant a lot to me this year, and 2 songs from each of them. 
In somewhat random order.</p>

<h1>Life Without Buildings</h1><p class="right" style="margin-bottom: 300px;"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:3SRh3Botwzzo9hTLOYpzXI" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe> 
<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:5SiviUS0C67SXSgnB0ufXI" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>
<div class="s"><p class="left">The biggest musical event for me this year was rediscovering Life Without Buildings. I had been a big fan of ‘The Leanover’ for a while, but this year I listened to “Live At The Annadale Hotel” for the first time, and the version of ‘The Leanover’ on there floored me.
Has there ever been a thing so radiant and brimming with life?
This song has never failed to give me chills. It never disappoints. And how could it? There is so much here I hardly know where to begin. The whole album is the same way. “Any Other City,” their only other album, is also fantastic, and despite having pretty much the same track-list as its live counterpart, feels very different. The arrangements and the singing are much more subdued. I really can't recommend either of them enough, but Live At The Annadale is where my heart lives.
The stage banter. The music. The singing. All if it so bursting with joy.
on paper its pretty weird music, often rambling, incoherent, yelpy, but listen to the confidence, the conviction, the character in her voice, they are undeniable. They clearly mean so much to her, and I don't know that I understand what she is trying to convey but damn do I feel it. And this is the power of it to me, the phrases spat everywhere, repeated, shifted in inflection, sped up, slowed down, the meaning changes every time. I get the sense that Sue is playing with them in the same way, turning thoughts over in her mind like stones in a river, trying to smooth them out and make sense of them by tumbling them around and bumping them against each other. This is perhaps what I like most in music, when it makes just enough sense, but not too much. When artistic intention and personal interpretation can dance together and songs are malleable to be what you need them to be. Life Without Buildings is the sound of being yourself; so transparently, forcefully, ecstatically.
</p></div>

<h1>The Replacements</h1><p class="right"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:3fnL2JDgy4QD04araOl0eY" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe> <iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:5nIbR3oQhYCxa2SiT3jvvO" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>
<div class="s"><p class="left">My relationship to The Replacements this year was similar, having previously only known "Alex Chilton," loving it, but never going deeper than that. Fortunately, The Replacements have a much more substantial catalog than Life Without Buildings, so there was lots of room to explore. They balance the jockiness and cockiness of classic rock with a sensitivity and vulnerability that really hit home for me.
</p></div>

<h1>Julianna Barwick</h1><p class="right"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:7r0wTz4E5189acrubL5t4W" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:3pZFELvBBVrlee8iq4uHO3" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>
<div class="s"><p class="left">Those first cold, fragile breaths. Change is hard sometimes. Disorienting, difficult to accept.
But The Harbinger is here to help. A repetitive meditative process, slowly working at it, getting used to it. 
You're on your own at first, but a chorus of voices and strings helps you keep moving, all building to that supremely cathartic "AHHHHH!"
No song moved me more than this one this year.
Julianna's music is so powerful to me because it elevates something so simple, just voice (not even lyrics) to a transcendent place, beyond what she could express in words. The dense airy feeling of these songs, punctuated by the strength and emotion of her voice makes them both calming and empowering.
</p></div>

<h1>Eleanor Friedberger</h1><p class="right"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:6cg8ne068x3OmcRXnpU3bq" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:0mFzH1q62MNcGt8QGYEYIu" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>
<div class="s"><p class="left">Eleanor captures the confused joyful feeling of being in love and the dizzying confusion of heartbreak so well. She steps between these from song to song, blending honest personal reflection with catchy hooks. In a few places, she cleverly omits the end of a verse, allowing us to fill in the blank, minimizing the distance between listener and songwriter, between her experience and ours. Personal Record is perhaps my favorite of this year, with witty but poignant songwriting throughout, beautifully delivered by Eleanor's charismatic voice.
</p></div>

<h1>Haim</h1><p class="right"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:2319gHincsCeSmc19Efi2j" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:6golelYKuy85o3u0cxIxFK" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>
<div class="s"><p class="left">The sisters in Haim don't just sing their feelings, they shout, spit, pop and wail them all over the place. The trials of the heart they detail on Days Are Gone deserve nothing less. The emotions are not so simple and the complex inflections on these songs are so good at emphasizing that fact, all while adding layers of interesting rhythm. If only they were easy to sing along with.</p></div>

<h1>Majical Cloudz</h1><p class="right"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:51JqEMXnFvWsfiVDUMCZLk" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:6DqyJXgJvl4h7K6zhCszjh" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>
<div class="s"><p class="left">The first moment of Impersonator has a warbled clarity to it, it feels like the sound of thoughts coming into focus. Hearing it commands my attention, which is appropriate. Majical Clouds want you to hear and feel everything they are going through. The emotional directness and simplicity of their songs encourage a breakdown in the relationship between listener and performer, acknowledging the vulnerability of both. I was lucky enough to see their album release show at Glasslands and it was brutally honest and like nothing else.</p></div>


<h1>Eluvium</h1><p class="right"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:70bRVTFz68mxzl6xiVxigB" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:4EHmxrGLuZ4GyxGswac9Dt" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>
<div class="s"><p class="left">I feel similarly about Eluvium as I do about Julianna Barwick. And by that I mean that I think of their work less as 'music' and more or as a 'spiritual experience.' They speak in celestial tongues. Matt Cooper's music has helped me through a lot over the years and this album is no exception, this is healing music. It's as noisy as he's been since Lambent Material with sprinkles of all of his other styles everywhere, from gorgeous solo piano work to throbbing drones and clattering drums.
</p></div>

<h1>CHVRCHES</h1><p class="right"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:3KMImfwJj3KXa6M3QRYsqH" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:3o7YDExXZ1ByruC3I7kGWP" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>
<div class="s"><p class="left">For some reason CHVRCHES didn't click with me when my sister first sent me The Mother We Share. But it has grown on me so much. What's not to love?, it's a ridiculous "we're all in this together" synth dance jam! About siblings! Why aren't there more of these? (Are there other than Brothersport?) I think about my sister every time I listen to it and it puts a huge grin on my face, imagining us having a wild dance party to it. The rest of their songs are great too of course. And many conjure similar feelings of joy in response to waning relationships and the ecstatic realization that things could actually be better if they were over.
</p></div>

<h1>Jannele Monae</h1><p class="right"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:3HW030T8eqPs8wpsgZqCGM" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:69vzkewKl2LPquyEiqD8BB" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>
<div class="s"><p class="left">Monae's tales of a cyborg future as social commentary continue to be engrossing, poignant, and very funky. I think i danced to these two tracks walking home more than any others. This is some seriously liberating music, questioning social norms, embracing the self, and dancing in the face of anyone who's ever judged you or questioned your identity.</p></div>

<h1>Andrew Cedermark</h1><p class="right"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:67fAekzM9Dt6WUlD3U2CKC" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:5nVbMiKCCSElrwB67v1s1K" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>
<div class="s"><p class="left">The power of the climax in Tiller of Lawn, when he screams along with the guitars "Come on say you know!" Crying out for connection, understanding
Cedermark sings of memories, we're all in this together, i hope?</p></div>

<h1>Deafheaven</h1><p class="right"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:6l3A2EWZSOA8LTMmzRCyD3" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:0whlO9oEAYISh4plID7lXa" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>
<div class="s"><p class="left">Sunbather feels like running to me. The blast beats galloping. Running away from something, screaming under your breath or at the top of your lings, turning around to spit curses at what you're running from.
every change of pace a corner turned. Or running towards something, something you can't reach fast enough. Or just running for the sake of running, to feel your body move and experience what that does for you mind. Reflection, progress, hear your breathing as the din subsides to moments of graceful beauty. You're alive. Then the explosion of motivation to change, to run again, bursts forth so powerfully. The start and end of Sunbather are some of the most ecstatic and excruciating music I have ever heard. Go for a run to these songs. It is an incredible experience, a visceral reminder of music's impact.</p></div>

<h1>Young Galaxy</h1><p class="right"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:4coWC9N5kCSlq1agbjISKS" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:2qiOUChY9yO9ppBAPpXRrk" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>
<div class="s"><p class="left">Young Galaxy put out a fantastic album this year, full of songs in the spirit of "We Have Everything" (which is probably my favorite song of the decade). They manage to write ebullient songs that blur the line between romance and platonic love, celebrating the simple joy of shared experience, of companionship. The power and restraint of Catherine McCandless's voice is intoxicating.
Pro tip: the deluxe version of Ultramarine has some phenomenal tracks that didnt make the album and is definitely worth checking out.
</p></div>

<h1>Moonface</h1><p class="right"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:5xL9buPYiVOmdo7UHc7y5U" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:2JWBgEMZenJlaNs06Mi4Nr" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>
<div class="s"><p class="left">The songwriting on "Everyone is Noah, Everyone is the Arc" is almost too perfect. Every line falls so neatly and pleasantly into place. Built around a fairly simple metaphor and fleshed out just enough to get the point across without being overbearing. Krug can still wail like he did in his former bands and he really lets loose in a few glorious moments on Julia With Blue Jeans On, and the power of his voice hits harder here due to the bare instrumentation. I loved the thick and twisty backing he had in Sunset Rubdown and Wolf Parade, but its amazing to hear him this raw.</p></div>

<h1>The Naked and Famous</h1><p class="right"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:2uXWgJB6VYBHFLF6tFKuTy" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:3nxMXF2LGJJ5sJNbdMjy7C" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>
<div class="s"><p class="left">Rolling Waves is HUUUUGE. They set up such good relationship drama through these songs. There are many great moments, but I think my favorite part is in Grow Old, where the vocalists do all the work, while the rest of the band buzzes at their instruments at the background, slowly building tension, threatening to explode, just like the lovers in conversation. Then it all happens and its is glorious. "In rolling waves of incidence/you made your bed/now sleep in it, you prince" Is the best slap in the face put to tape this year.</p></div>

<h1>The Appleseed Cast</h1><p class="right"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:4Vy6JQDttCb588rDTJQI2R" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:5rJPYDoNC8Pl8KWwREnZUE" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>
<div class="s"><p class="left">This is their strongest album since 2006's Peregrine, which may have been my favorite album of high school.
The mix of post rock with emo feels very cathartic to me, and this album was a go-to for me to dance off the stress of a day on the train home.
The drumming in particular is what gets me, throughout this album it is superb.</p></div>

<h1>Braids</h1><p class="right"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:0k6PyX09uLfpdPBnwhhOeU" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:7DwsxZASu9wW7YpxAN4twP" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>
<div class="s"><p class="left">I saw them perform Flourish // Perish in its entirety, when I was expecting to hear mostly songs from Native Speaker and it was a bewildering but amazing experience. These songs still have the cerebral grace that made Native Speaker so wonderful, but feel a bit colder.</p></div>

<h1>Iron and Wine</h1><p class="right"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:6EvFPkPbgkV7jDNFGGxoaq" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:0wifVV15LvdySuHkaSuXtA" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>
<div class="s"><p class="left">Iron and Wine did what Iron and Wine does best this year. These tracks are laid back, effortless grooves like summer winds, peppered with harmonious voices bobbing like tides. Few songs felt more carefree and comfortable to me, a couch waiting for sleeping body.
</p></div>

<h1>Chance the Rapper</h1><p class="right"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
<br>
<div class="s"><p class="left">- Cocoa Butter Kisses (feat. Vic Mensa &amp; Twista)<br>
- Juice<br><br>
I like this mixtape because Chance is so honest, vulnerable and often joyful on each track. His voice is unlike anything else, morphing from high pitched grunts, to smooth singing and breathless rapping. The lyrics are mostly a revealing character study of Chicago, mixing poignant social commentary, occasionally offensive jabs, and catchy as hell beats. But really, Chance describes it better than I ever could: "this is what it's like to go to a gifted school, to be addicted to drugs, and to be 18 in Chicago"</p></div>

<h1>Jai Paul</h1><p class="right"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
<br>
<div class="s"><p class="left">- Str8 Outta Mumbai<br>
- All Night<br><br>
Falling into Jai Paul's wormhole of an debut/demo/leak is such a joy. He creates dense but crystal clear collages of sound. Jai's songs feel like a message from the future, conjuring a landscape like Tron or Akira. But underneath, he writes fairly simple songs of love and longing. Its a gorgeous blend of technology and humanity.</p></div>

<h1>Sinkane</h1><p class="right"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:2gJDkPbM0fl7OaO4hny5TC" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<div class="s"><p class="left">I used to live in a big house in Vermont. One dat we got a free piano off craigslist to help fill the space.
Pushed it from one porch into an orchard truck, and then onto our porch. I still remember the first thing Pete played on it.
Some ragtime number, filling the whole house with its slightly out of tune sound and late fall light. A few days later i heard him
jamming on the notes that would become the melody for fields</p></div>
